# RetinoNet 🧿
> Retinopathy detection using Deep Learning

---

## 🚀 Overview
**RetinoNet** is an AI-driven platform for early detection of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images.  
It leverages a deep learning model to classify images and provides users with an intuitive web interface to upload images, view diagnostic results, and access past reports.

The goal is to make retinal disease detection more **accessible**, **scalable**, and **accurate** — helping to prevent vision loss through early intervention.
